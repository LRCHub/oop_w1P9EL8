[01:05.94] On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
[01:12.57] Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
[01:18.83] Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
[01:24.85] My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[01:28.26] I had to stop for the night
[01:41.76] 
[01:31.69] There she stood in the doorway, I heard the mission bell
[01:38.18] And I was thinking to myself
[01:40.26] "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
[01:44.48] Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
[01:50.97] There were voices down the corridor
[01:53.82] I thought I heard them say
[02:06.82] 
[01:57.12] Welcome to the Hotel California
[02:02.86] Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
[02:06.05] Such a lovely face
[02:09.49] There's plenty of room at the Hotel California
[02:15.46] Any time of year (any time of year)
[02:18.89] You can find it here
[02:28.89] 
[02:22.52] Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
[02:29.08] She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
[02:35.54] How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
[02:42.08] Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
[03:04.08] 
[02:48.25] So I called up the Captain, "Please bring me my wine"
[02:53.83] He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"
[03:01.28] And still those voices are calling from far away
[03:07.78] Wake you up in the middle of the night
[03:10.95] Just to hear them say
[03:21.45] 
[03:14.07] Welcome to the Hotel California
[03:19.66] Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)
[03:22.76] Such a lovely face
[03:26.16] They livin' it up at the Hotel California
[03:32.42] What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
[03:35.69] Bring your alibis
[03:44.19] 
[03:39.74] Mirrors on the ceiling, the pink champagne on ice
[03:44.75] And she said, "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
[03:52.35] And in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
[03:58.69] They stab it with their steely knives
[04:01.23] But they just can't kill the beast
[04:18.23] 
[04:05.12] Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
[04:11.95] I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
[04:17.91] "Relax," said the night man, "We are programmed to receive
[04:24.59] You can check-out any time you like
[04:27.47] But you can never leave"
